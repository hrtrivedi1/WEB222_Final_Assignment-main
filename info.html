                  Chess has a lengthy and fascinating history that dates back more than a thousand years. The 6th century is where the game is thought to have started, where it was known as chaturanga and was played on a board with 64 squares. The game originated in India and migrated to Persia, where it changed into shatranj and gained popularity among Muslims. Shatranj later migrated to the Islamic world before arriving in Europe, where it underwent significant modifications to become the modern game of chess. Chess' modern rules were created in Spain in the 15th century, and from there, the game quickly spread throughout Europe and beyond. Chess has been played for centuries by individuals of various ages and socioeconomic levels and has had a profound impact on human history. It is still one of the most played and engaging board games in the world today.

               <h2>Game rules and objective</h2>
               <p>
                  Chess's goal is to checkmate your opponent's king. This signifies the king is being attacked (in "check") and will be captured on the next move. The game takes place on a checkered board with 64 squares laid out in an 8x8 grid.

                  Each player is given 16 pieces to begin with: a king, a queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The pieces move according to precise rules: pawns travel one or two squares forward on their first move, then one square at a time, while the other pieces move in various combinations of directions. The queen is the most powerful piece, able to move in any direction along a straight line, whereas the king is the most essential piece and must always be safeguarded. The game might end in a variety of ways, including checkmate, resignation, time control, a draw, or forfeit. To win at chess, a player must tactically use their pieces, anticipating their opponent's actions and thinking several steps ahead.
